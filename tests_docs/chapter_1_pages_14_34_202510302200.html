      <h1>Chapter 1: How the Regulations Apply to Domestic Property</h1>
      <p class="lede">The Regulations mean that a domestic private rented property in England or Wales should not be let if its energy performance indicator is below EPC E. This chapter is aimed at domestic landlords and outlines the factors landlords need to consider when determining if a property they let is covered by the minimum level of energy efficiency provisions. Enforcement authorities and others with an interest in domestic rented property will also find this information useful. <span data-source-page="14"></span></p>

      <section id="ch1-1-1" data-chunk="subsection" data-level="1.1.1">
        <h3>1.1.1 Properties covered by the minimum level of energy efficiency provisions</h3>
        <p>The Regulations apply to all domestic PRS properties in England and Wales which are: <span data-source-page="14"></span></p>
        <ul>
          <li>let under certain types of domestic tenancy (see section 1.1.2), and</li>
          <li>legally required to have an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) (see section 1.1.4).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Where both conditions are met, the property is covered irrespective of type, tenancy length, location, listed status, or size. Where either condition is not met, the property is not covered. <span data-source-page="14"></span></p>

          <h4>Licence vs Tenancy</h4>
          <p>Licences are not the same as tenancies and do not count as tenancies for these Regulations. A tenancy grants exclusive possession; a licence is merely permission to do something on the property. Seek legal advice if unsure whether an arrangement is a licence or tenancy. </p>

        <h3>1.1.2 Relevant Tenancies (regulation 19)</h3>
        <p>For the purposes of the domestic minimum standard the relevant tenancy types are: <span data-source-page="15"></span></p>
        <ul>
          <li>An assured tenancy (including an assured shorthold tenancy) defined in the Housing Act 1988;</li>
          <li>A regulated tenancy defined in the Rent Act 1977;</li>
          <li>A domestic agricultural tenancy as set out in the Energy Efficiency (Domestic Private Rented Property) Order 2015:
            <ul>
              <li>An assured agricultural occupancy (Housing Act 1988, s.24);</li>
              <li>A protected occupancy (Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976, s.3(6));</li>
              <li>A statutory tenancy (Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976, s.4(6)).</li>

          <p>The minimum standards do not apply to the social housing sector. A property let on a listed tenancy type is excluded if it is low cost rental or low cost home ownership accommodation under the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 (sections 69–70), or where the landlord is registered as a social landlord. </p>

        <p>A property meets the minimum standard if, from the trigger dates in section 1.2.1, it has a valid EPC showing a rating of E or above. A property is sub-standard (non-compliant) if a valid EPC shows F or G; in such cases the landlord must either improve to EPC E (see chapter two) or register an exemption (see chapter four). <span data-source-page="16"></span></p>

          <h4>1.1.4.1 EPC Overview</h4>
          <p>The Regulations apply only to properties legally required to have an EPC (e.g., at sale, letting, construction, or qualifying modification) under relevant legislation. Not having a required EPC is unlawful and may result in penalties. <span data-source-page="17-18"></span></p>

          <p>An EPC is valid for ten years. There is no automatic requirement to commission a new EPC when one expires unless a new trigger occurs (sale, letting to a new tenant, or qualifying modification). A post-improvement EPC is recommended to evidence compliance. <span data-source-page="19"></span></p>

          <p>Where multiple EPCs exist (e.g., whole building and discrete unit), the relevant EPC is the one for the “property” being let (building or part). Improvements required relate to the property being let. <span data-source-page="19-20"></span></p>

          <p>Examples include protected/listed buildings where compliance would unacceptably alter character, places of worship, certain temporary or small standalone buildings (&lt;50m²), specified industrial/agricultural buildings with low energy demand, and some Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) not previously sold/let as a single unit. <span data-source-page="20-21"></span></p>

      <p>Where buildings include mixed residential and commercial units, the Regulations apply to rented units within such buildings; triggers depend on whether units are domestic or non-domestic.

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions Relevant to Chapter One</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>When did the minimum standard provisions come into force?</dt>
        <dd>For new domestic tenancy agreements from 1 April 2018; for all tenancies from 1 April 2020 (unless a lawful exemption applies). <span data-source-page="31"></span></dd>

        <dt>What tenancy types are covered?</dt>
        <dd>Assured (including assured shorthold), regulated, and specified domestic agricultural tenancies. <span data-source-page="31"></span></dd>

        <dt>Are these Regulations UK-wide?</dt>
        <dd>No. They apply to England and Wales only. <span data-source-page="31"></span></dd>

        <dt>When must properties be at EPC E?</dt>
        <dd>All covered domestic PRS properties must be at EPC E (or have a valid exemption) by 1 April 2020. Between 1 April 2018 and 1 April 2020, compliance was required on entry into a new tenancy. <span data-source-page="31"></span></dd>

        <dt>Are Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) excluded?</dt>
        <dd>HMOs are not excluded. Where legally required to have an EPC and let on a relevant tenancy, they are in scope (note: individual rooms usually do not require their own EPC). <span data-source-page="32-33"></span></dd>
