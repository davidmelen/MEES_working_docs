Q2- I am  renewing an assured shorthold tenancy (AST) in Wales and my Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) from 2015 is an F. Do I need to get to E before renewal, and can I still rely on the same EPC because it is under 10 years old?

Q2E My tenant wants to sublet a room. Am I still responsible for MEES compliance, and does anything change after 1 April 2020?

Q2E It is a listed building in a conservation area. Do I actually need an EPC, and if not, does MEES still apply to me?

Q2E I run a House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) let as individual rooms — do the rooms need their own EPCs, and if the whole‑building EPC is F, am I in scope of MEES?

Q2E My cottage is furnished holiday accommodation and I cover the energy bills — is an EPC required, and if it isn’t, does that mean MEES doesn’t apply?

Q2E One place is on a regulated tenancy that started in the 80s — do MEES apply, and do I need to do anything now if there’s no EPC on record?

Q2E I rent out a detached garden annexe under 50 m² — do I need an EPC, and if not, am I outside MEES?

Q3- I’m about to grant a new tenancy on 1 May 2019 for a flat in England with an EPC F — do I have to improve to E before I sign, what if the EPC expires in 2024, and would it be different if I’d renewed with the same tenant in March 2018?

Q3E I own a shop with a flat above and I let the whole thing on one agreement — is that domestic or non‑domestic for MEES, which EPC (flat only or whole building) counts, and which trigger dates apply?

Q3E I grabbed a voluntary EPC for my HMO last year even though I didn’t need one — if I now market rooms, does that pull me into MEES, and can I switch to an EPC for the discrete units instead?

Q3E We’ve got a 20‑year tenancy from 2009; the EPC done in 2009 expired in 2019 — can we keep letting after April 2020 without upgrading, do we need a new EPC now, and when would MEES bite for us?

Q3- I’m a leaseholder landlord and my tenant wants to sublet after April 2020 — who has to get to EPC E, do they need my consent to make improvements, and what if the freeholder has restrictions?

Q3E I rent out one room in my own home while I still live there — is that a licence or a tenancy for MEES purposes, do I need an EPC, and does MEES apply at all?

Q3E My block has separate EPCs for each flat plus a different EPC for the whole building — if my flat is E but the building is F, which one matters for MEES, and do I need to upgrade common parts?

Q4- I’m in Wales letting an assured shorthold tenancy (AST): the EPC is from 2014 and shows F; it expires next year — do I need to get to E before I renew with the same tenant in June, do I have to commission a new EPC after the works, what happens if I haven’t hit E by 1 April 2020, and can the council ask for my paperwork?

Q4E My Victorian terrace is in a conservation area and probably ‘breathes’ — do I need an EPC to market to a new tenant, if an EPC isn’t legally required do MEES still apply, who decides if upgrades would ‘unacceptably alter the character’, and should I use the flat’s EPC or the whole‑building EPC if both exist?

Q4E I’ve got a farm cottage on a domestic agricultural tenancy — am I in scope, do the 1 April 2018 / 1 April 2020 dates apply, which EPC is relevant if it’s part of a mixed‑use farmhouse, and what if the tenancy allows subletting after 2020?

Q4E I’ve let a self‑contained bedsit within a house share — is that classed as a dwelling for MEES, do I need an individual EPC for the room, if the house EPC is F can I still let the room after April 2020, and does anything change if I switch to a licence?

Q4- I’m buying a rental flat mid‑tenancy — do MEES obligations already apply even though I’m not changing the tenancy, do I need to check there’s a valid EPC before completion, if the EPC has expired does MEES still apply right now, and when would I have to get a new EPC?

Q4E I rent a converted barn with a tiny attached office the tenant uses a couple of days a week — is that mixed‑use treated as domestic or non‑domestic for MEES, which EPC do I rely on, do the domestic trigger dates still apply, and what if there’s only a commercial EPC on file?

Q4E I gave my tenant permission to sublet in 2019 — if they become a ‘landlord’ to their sub‑tenant, who’s responsible for getting to EPC E, does anything change after 1 April 2020, do they need my consent to carry out improvements, and what happens if the head‑lease bans alterations?
