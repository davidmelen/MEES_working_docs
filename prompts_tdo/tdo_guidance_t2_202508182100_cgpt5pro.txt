# ====== ROLE & AUDIENCE ======
You are creating Tier‑2 customer support content (clear guidance, not legal advice) for UK landlords about the Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES).

# ====== SOURCE SCOPE ======
- Use ONLY chapter {CHAPTER_NUMBER} (“{CHAPTER_NAME}”) of the PDF "{PDF_FILE_NAME}".
- Treat the chapter as pages {PAGE_RANGE} of the PDF and cite ONLY that range.
- If you MUST pull a short definition that chapter {CHAPTER_NUMBER} relies on, you MAY reference the Glossary (pp. 6–7) for definitions ONLY—no other content.
- Every factual statement MUST carry a data-source attribute pointing to the exact PDF page(s) you used.

# ====== GOAL ======
Produce ONE self‑contained **HTML5** file (lang={LOCALE}) aimed at Tier‑2 landlord support agents and knowledgeable landlords. It must be practical (what to check/do), accurate to chapter {CHAPTER_NUMBER}, and escalation‑ready (flag Tier‑3 handoffs for legal/complex scenarios).

# ====== STYLE ======
- UK English, plain language, short sentences, avoid legal advice.
- No external CSS/JS; minimal inline CSS only for readability.
- No images.
- Keep neutral, instructional tone; prefer “If… then…” patterns.

# ====== STRICT STRUCTURE & MARKUP SPEC ======
(Apply ALL of these. They are hard requirements.)

1) Primary content wrapper
   - Wrap the entire article in: `<main id="main" role="main"><article id="{DOC_ID}" data-doc-id="{DOC_ID}" data-topic="{PRODUCT}" data-jurisdiction="England,Wales"> … </article></main>`

2) Headings & ToC
   - Exactly one `<h1>`.
   - Use `<h2>` for main topics, `<h3>` for subtopics; no level jumps.
   - Every H1/H2/H3 MUST have a stable `id` (slug); never rename once assigned.
   - Insert a Table of Contents immediately after the H1:
     ```html
     <nav class="toc" aria-label="Table of contents">
       <ul>… <a href="#{section-id}">Heading text</a> …</ul>
     </nav>
     ```

3) Chunking model (DOM‑first; semantics over tokens)
   - Break content into `<section>` chunks aligned to topics (≤400 words each).
   - **Leaf sections** (hard chunk boundaries): `article > section`, `section.faq-item`, and `article > aside.escalation`.
   - **Container sections** (do NOT chunk by these): the parent FAQ container (e.g., `section#faq`)—it exists for navigation only.
   - Assign **ALL** sections:
     - `id="<semantic-slug>"`
     - `data-chunk-id="{DOC_ID}-sNN"` (sequential, zero‑padded; NN = 01, 02, …)
     - `data-role="<one-of: summary|howto|faq|reference|troubleshooting|escalation|section>"`
     - `data-updated="<today’s ISO date>"`
     - `data-chunk-hash="sha1:XXXXXXXX"` where XXXXXXXX is the first 8 hex of the SHA‑1 of the section’s **normalized text** (if you cannot compute reliably, put `sha1:PLACEHOLDER` and keep stable between drafts).

   - Target sizes by type:
     - **FAQ item:** 150–350 tokens, no overlap.
     - **Procedural/how‑to:** 250–450 tokens, allow 5–10% sentence‑boundary overlap if splitting within a section.
     - **Narrative/reference:** 350–550 tokens, up to 10–20% overlap if needed.

4) Doc‑level metadata island (machine‑readable)
   - In `<head>` add:
     ```html
     <script type="application/json" data-role="doc-metadata">
     {
       "doc_id": "{DOC_ID}",
       "product": "{PRODUCT}",
       "version": "{PDF_DATE_PUBLISHED}",
       "audience": "{AUDIENCE}",
       "permissions": "{PERMISSIONS}",
       "effective_date": "<today’s ISO date>",
       "tags": {TAGS},
       "toc": true
     }
     </script>
     ```
   - Also include `<meta name="last-modified" content="<today’s ISO date>">`.

5) Structured data (JSON‑LD)
   - Tech article block in `<head>`:
     ```html
     <script type="application/ld+json">
     {
       "@context": "https://schema.org",
       "@type": "TechArticle",
       "name": "{PDF_TITLE} — Chapter {CHAPTER_NUMBER}: {CHAPTER_NAME}",
       "about": "Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) for the domestic private rented sector",
       "inLanguage": "{LOCALE}",
       "jurisdiction": "England, Wales",
       "datePublished": "{PDF_DATE_PUBLISHED}",
       "dateModified": "<today’s ISO date>",
       "version": "Chapter {CHAPTER_NUMBER} (Landlord guidance, Apr 2020)",
       "isPartOf": { "@type": "CreativeWork", "name": "{PDF_TITLE}" }
     }
     </script>
     ```
   - FAQ JSON‑LD at the end mirroring the Q/A items you output.

6) Must‑have content blocks (in this order)
   A. **Header (intro + disclaimer)**  
      - Who this is for; short 1–2 sentence lede.  
      - Prominent disclaimer: general guidance, not legal advice.

   B. **Quick compliance checks** (H2)  
      - Ordered list with `ol[data-type="checks"]`.  
      - Each `li` uses if/then wording and carries `data-step` and (if useful) `data-outcome`.  
      - Every item that states a rule/date/example has `data-source-page="N"` or `"N–M"` and an inline endnote link `<a href="#sources">[p. N]</a>`.

   C. **Eligibility decision steps** (H2)  
      - `ol[data-type="steps"]` with succinct, actionable steps; cite each step.

   D. **Reference sections** (H2/H3 as needed)  
      - Short paragraphs, each with `data-source-page` + endnote.

   E. **Escalation guardrails** (aside.escalation)  
      - `<aside id="escalate-tier-3" class="escalation" data-role="escalation">`  
      - Bullet list; each `li` `data-escalation="true"`, one‑line reason, and source page.

   F. **FAQ** (container H2) + **per‑question sections**  
      - Parent container `<section id="faq" data-role="faq">` for navigation only.  
      - Each Q/A is its own `<section class="faq-item" id="faq-<slug>" data-role="faq">` with an H3 question and a short answer paragraph(s).  
      - Every FAQ answer has `data-source-page` + endnote.  
      - Mirror the FAQ items into a final JSON‑LD `FAQPage` block.

   G. **Micro‑glossary** (H2)  
      - `<dl id="glossary">`; include only terms referenced in this chapter.  
      - First occurrence in body wraps terms as `<span data-term="Term">term</span>`.  
      - Each definition carries `data-source-page` and an endnote.

   H. **Sources** (H2 at end)  
      - A compact bullet list: each cited page/range with a short label of what it supports.

7) Citations (strict)
   - **Every paragraph** that states a rule/date/definition/example MUST include `data-source-page="N"` (or `"N–M"`) and a compact endnote link `<a href="#sources">[p. N]</a>`.  
   - Page numbers MUST be from {PAGE_RANGE} (or Glossary pp. 6–7 when a definition is strictly necessary).

8) Accessibility & readability
   - Semantic HTML5; each block‑level element on its own line; 2‑space indentation.
   - No images. Tables (if any) require `<caption>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `scope` attributes.

9) Stability & IDs
   - Freeze all generated `id` and `data-chunk-id` values once emitted; do not drift them if wording changes.
   - `data-chunk-id` MUST follow `{DOC_ID}-sNN` (e.g., `mees-ch2-s01`).

# ====== OUTPUT FORMAT ======
- Please provide the entire HTML file wrapped inside a single fenced code block so I can copy it with the ChatGPT copy button. Start with `<!doctype html>` and `<html lang="{LOCALE}">` and finsish with </html>.
- DO NOT include any explanation, commentary, or markdown—**just the HTML**.
- Keep each section ≤400 words.
- Ensure every H1/H2/H3 has an `id`, every `<section>` has `id`, `data-chunk-id`, `data-role`, `data-updated`, and `data-chunk-hash`.
- Include both JSON‑LD blocks (TechArticle in `<head>`, FAQPage at end).

# ====== QUALITY BAR ======
- Accurate to chapter {CHAPTER_NUMBER} meaning; summarise in your own words.
- Every rule/date/definition/example MUST have a `data-source-page`.
- DOM‑first chunking: never merge across two different `.faq-item` sections.
- Use consistent IDs/anchors suitable for RAG retrieval.
